#h1 L-Soft LISTSERV 16.5 Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

The `REPORT` parameter used by the `wa.exe` component of LISTSERV 16.5 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to improper sanitization of user input. By closing the HTML tag after the `z` parameter (as shown below), JavaScript can be injected into the URL before the `a` parameter. 
*note versions prior to 16.5 may also be affected but have not been tested.*
